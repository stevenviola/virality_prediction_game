This game is part of my ongoing research on the nature of popularity in social platforms. It is usually assumed that upvoting and downvoting systems, like the one used on Reddit<sup>1</sup>, allows the "best" things to rise to the front page but we don't know if this is actually true. In fact there is a lot of interesting analysis which shows that factors like the time of day that you post has a large influence on the success of your post<sup>2</sup>. So if factors like time of day, which has nothing to do with the content of your post, play a large influence in post success, do these systems really surface the best content? </p>

<p>This game tests this theory by seeing if people, ideally ones who use Reddit, can predict which image received more upvotes on Reddit. If you can keep your prediction score well-above 50%, then maybe Reddit's voting system reliably surfaces the best content. If not, there might be more to the story.
