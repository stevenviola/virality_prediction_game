<p>What makes an image popular on Reddit? Is there some secret sauce or is all just random? This game tests your ability to identify popularity on Reddit. </p>

<h3> Instructions </h3>
<p>In each round you will see a pair of pictures. Both pictures were posted to the same subreddit in 2014 and were voted upon by Reddit's community. Every upvote a picture receives adds 1 to its karma score, and each downvote subtracts 1 from its karma score. Try to guess which one received a higher karma score. </p>
