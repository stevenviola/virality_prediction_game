<p>What makes an image popular on Reddit? Is there some secret sauce or is all just random? This game tests your ability to identify popularity on Reddit. </p>

<h3> Instructions </h3>
<p> You will see a series of pairs of images. Both pictures were posted to the same subreddit in 2014 and were voted upon by Reddit's community. Every upvote adds 1 to a picture's karma score, and each downvote subtracts 1. Try to guess which one received a higher karma score. </p>
