<p>What makes an image popular on Reddit? Is there some secret sauce or is all just random? This game tests your ability to identify popularity on Reddit. In each round you will see a pair of pictures that were posted to the same subreddit in the same month during 2014. Try to guess which one received a higher score. To begin, choose a subreddit from the list below: 


<!-- Single button -->
<div class="btn-group">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-large dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
    Choose subreddit <span class="caret"></span>
  </button>
  <ul class="dropdown-menu">
    <li><a href="/render_game?article_source=aww">Aww</a></li>
    <li><a href="/render_game?article_source=pics">Pics</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
