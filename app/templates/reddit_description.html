<p>

<a href="http://www.reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a> is a website where people submit links to articles, photos, and videos from around the web. Then other users of Reddit (dubbed Redditors) can upvote, indicating that they like the content or think it adds to a positive experience of the site, or downvote those submissions. Each upvotes adds 1 to a submission's karma score and each downvote subtracts 1 from the kamra score. Reddit uses these karma scores to determine the ranking of articles on its site. <p>

<p> When a link is submitted to Reddit, it must be submitted to a particular subreddit, which is a part of the website dedicated to a particular topic. For example, <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/news' target="_blank">reddit.com/r/news</a> focuses on the news, while <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aww" target="blank">reddit.com/r/aww</a> is dedicated to pictures of cute animals. This division of topics allows users to more easily find the content they are interested in. However, some subreddits can be quite general, such as <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/pics'>reddit.com/r/pics</a>, which is a subreddit for any type of image.
